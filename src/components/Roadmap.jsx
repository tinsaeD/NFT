            <p>From the start, our project has been focused on creating a digital art of the unique creature of Walia Ibex and building a kind community. Early adopters of the community will be able to mint digital arts of Ibex NFTs. Once the initial distribution is complete, we build use cases around the community. These are venues for Metaverse based Ibexes, beautiful merches and more.</p>
